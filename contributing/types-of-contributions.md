# Types of contributions :memo:
You can contribute to TrustML several ways. This repo is a place to discuss and collaborate on! 

### :lady_beetle: Issues
[Issues] are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. If an issue has a triage label, we haven't reviewed it yet, and you shouldn't begin work on it.

If you've found something in the content or the website that should be updated, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using a most appropiate label to ease its management.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Pull requests
A [pull request] is a way to suggest changes in our repository. When we merge those changes, they should be deployed to the live site within 24 hours. :earth_africa:

### :question: Support
If you are experiencing a problem with TrustML, unrelated to our documentation, please open an issue with the label *help question* or *question*.
